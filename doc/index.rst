Account Payment Days Module
###########################

The Account Payment Days Module manages party payment days which are taken
into account when calculating due dates in invoices.

For example, if a party has '5 20' as payment days, a due date that should
be on the 15th will be moved to the 20th of the same month. If the due date
should be on the 22th, then it will be moved to the 5th of the next month.
